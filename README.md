# Creative AI Tools: What Creators Need To Know
*Last Updated: October 28, 2025*

Hi, I'm Siddhi! My mission is to help artists better navigate the AI era.  

**Find me on:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@siddhisundar) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/siddhi.sundar) | [Newsletter](https://siddhisnewsletter.substack.com)  

Below is a comprehensive chart of 95 text, image, audio, video, and design tools with key details on privacy, data handling, ownership, and ethics. Updated each month to help creatives stay aware, empowered, and in control of their work when working with AI tools.  

**Key Caveats:** AI tool policies and features evolve rapidly due to legal, ethical, and technical changes. This chart is updated monthly based on available public information as of the last update date, but real-time shifts may occur, so always verify the latest terms directly on official websites or privacy centers before use. This is NOT intended as legal advice; use for informational purposes only to guide your research. Just trying to make artists' lives a little easier!

**Note on Transparency Labels:** Labels such as "Limited transparency" indicate that public information about training data, upload usage, or sharing policies is incomplete. This is often due to proprietary or legal constraints rather than companies intentionally withholding. Always verify directly with providers.

My perspective: there isn't a right or wrong answer here. Some artists I know choose to avoid these tools entirely; others don't mind and see it as contributing to the future of better technology. Zero judgment. The goal is simply to ask good questions and understand what's right for your own creative practice.

## 📝 NOTES

- **Policies change frequently** - Always verify current terms before use. For latest updates, check official sites or privacy centers. Providers often evolve practices based on feedback and legal developments.
- **Free vs. Paid plans** often differ in privacy, limits, and features.
- **Enterprise plans** provide enhanced controls, security, and compliance (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2).
- **Ethical concerns** persist with web scraping, but licensed training is rising due to legal challenges and company initiatives.
- **Privacy risks** include data misuse in generative AI; opt for tools with zero-retention and no-training clauses.
- **Consumer vs. enterprise**: Consumer tools (e.g., Gemini Apps) may process data under their privacy notice, while Google Workspace/Vertex AI state they do not use customer data to train models without permission.
- **October Trend**: California AI bills (e.g., SB 53, September 29, 2025) emphasize frontier AI transparency, impacting tools like Adobe and Google with stricter reporting.
