# Creative AI Tools: What Artists Need To Know
*Last Updated: August 21, 2025*

Hi, I'm Siddhi! My mission is to help artists better navigate the AI era.  
**Find me on:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@siddhisundar) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/siddhi.sundar) | [Newsletter](https://siddhisnewsletter.substack.com)  

Below is a comprehensive chart of 77 text, image, audio, video, and design tools with key details on privacy, data handling, ownership, and ethics. Updated each month to help creatives stay aware, empowered, and in control of their work when working with AI tools.  

**Key Caveats:** AI tool policies and features evolve rapidly due to legal, ethical, and technical changes. This chart is updated monthly based on available public information as of the last update date, but real-time shifts may occur, so always verify the latest terms directly on official websites or privacy centers before use. This is NOT intended as legal advice; use for informational purposes only to guide your research. Just trying to make artists' lives a little easier!

**Note on Transparency Labels:**
Labels such as “Limited transparency” indicate that public information about training data, upload usage, or sharing policies is incomplete. This is often due to proprietary or legal constraints rather than companies intentionally withholding. Always verify directly with providers.

My perspective: there isn’t a right or wrong answer here. Some artists I know choose to avoid these tools entirely; others don’t mind and see it as contributing to the future of better technology. Zero judgment. The goal is simply to ask good questions and understand what’s right for your own creative practice.

## August 2025 Update Highlights
- **New Tools Added**:
  - **Grok (xAI)**: Image generation with inputs used for training (via Flux, no opt-out).
  - **Eleven Music**: Audio generation with inputs used for training (opt-out available).
- **Key Privacy & Ownership Updates**:
  - **Flux**: Inputs/outputs used for training, no opt-out.
  - **Craiyon**: Broad license allows training use of prompts/images, no opt-out.
  - **Sora**: Public access launched (August 2025), inputs used for training unless opted out.
